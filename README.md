Introduction
============

As I was learning how to find quartiles of given datasets and hen drawing a box
diagram of them. I though why not writing a program that does it for me? Is this
not what being programmers is about?  
I made this simple python programs that, given it a numerical dataset, it will
retrieve some informationâ€™s about it.  
See next paragraph.

Example
=======

Original Dataset:

10, 15, 20, 51, 541, 1541, 541, 65, 36552, 1541, 3, 15, 41, 6541, 521, 541, 521,
5, 215, 1, 1541, 521, 541

The output will be:

The list has 23 elements.

The sorted list is : [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 15.0, 20.0, 41.0, 51.0, 65.0,
215.0, 521.0, 521.0, 521.0, 541.0, 541.0, 541.0, 541.0, 1541.0, 1541.0, 1541.0,
6541.0, 36552.0]

The median is : 521.0

Lower half is : [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 15.0, 20.0, 41.0, 51.0, 65.0, 215.0]

Upper half is : [521.0, 521.0, 541.0, 541.0, 541.0, 541.0, 1541.0, 1541.0,
1541.0, 6541.0, 36552.0]

The first quartile is : 15.0

The third quartile is : 541.0
